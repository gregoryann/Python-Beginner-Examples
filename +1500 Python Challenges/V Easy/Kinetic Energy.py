Kinetic Energy
Kinetic energy can be calculated with the following formula:

KE = 1/2mv²

m is mass in kg
v is velocity in m/s
KE is kinetic energy in J
Return the Kinetic Energy in Joules, given the mass and velocity. For the purposes of this challenge, round answers to the nearest integer.

Examples
calc_kinetic_energy(60, 3) ➞ 270

calc_kinetic_energy(45, 10) ➞ 2250

calc_kinetic_energy(63.5, 7.35) ➞ 1715
Notes
Expect only positive numbers for inputs.
