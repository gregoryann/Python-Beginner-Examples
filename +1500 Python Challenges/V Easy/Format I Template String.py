Format I: Template String
For each challenge of this series you do not need to submit a function. Instead, you need to submit a template string that can formatted in order to get a certain outcome.

Write a template string according to the following example:

Example
a = "John"
b = "Joe"
c = "Jack"
template = "yourtemplatestringhere"
template.format(a, b, c) ➞ "Their names were: John, Joe and Jack."
Tips
A template string is a string that uses curly braces {} as a placeholder that can then be formatted:

"hello, my name is {}".format("John") ➞ "hello, my name is John."
Notes
Submit a string, not a function.
Do not change the name of the variable template.
